## About

Blackboard is a simple theme and accompanying color scheme for Sublime Text 2. It is mostly derived from  [Flatland](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland), the right place to start for any custom theme development for Sublime. Thanks Flatland!


## Installation
Blackboard is a Sublime package. To install it:

1. [Download theme files](https://github.com/cfletcher1856/Theme-Blackboard/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip the files and copy the folder called "Theme - Blackboard" into your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory. You can find that directory by selecting "Preferences > Browse Packages ...".
3. Activate the theme by modifying your user preferences to include the following:

```javascript
{
  "theme": "Blackboard.sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Blackboard/Blackboard.tmtheme"
}
```

If you need help locating your user preferences file, you can find it selecting "Preferences > Settings - User".
